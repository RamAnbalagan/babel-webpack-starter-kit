# babel-webpack-starter-kit
Starter pack for ES6+ applications using Webpack and Babel. Transpiles it down to ES5

# Webpack

* Takes modules with dependenceis and builds static assets from them, which can run in a browser.
* It has presets! Presets are basically plugins which are needed when we need to use babel.
* `npm init` : Webpack allows you to use npm modules / ur own modules and generates static assets from them allowing your browser to run them. Without needing a node server. That's the beauty of webpack.
# Babel 

* Is a compiler that takes latest versions from Es6+ and brings it down to ES5
  
# Polyfill

Used for Async await support and other es2015 features!
